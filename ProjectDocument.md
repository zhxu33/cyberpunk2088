# Cyberpunk 2088 #

## Introduction ##

Cyberpunk 2088 is a 2D infinite progression game set in a neon-drenched, dystopian city teetering on the edge of chaos. Players take on the role of "W," a fearless mercenary on a mission to overthrow the oppressive Arasaka Corporation, a megacorporation that has plunged society into despair. Combining high-octane combat, endless level progression, and strategic upgrades, the game offers an exhilarating journey through an ever-evolving cyberpunk world. The ultimate goal is to infiltrate Arasaka's towering fortress, a sprawling skyscraper dominating the city skyline. However, upon breaching its inner sanctum, players uncover an unsettling truth: the interior is an infinite, procedurally generated loop, reflecting Arasaka’s mastery over both technology and reality. With dynamic action, engaging enemies, and a gripping narrative, Cyberpunk 2088 immerses players in a world where every battle pushes them closer to uncovering the secrets of a system built to control them. Will you break free or become another cog in the machine?

**Recommendation of Game playing**
As the player, you will see an NPC near the spawn location. At the beginning of the first level, you will have 100 coins to upgrade your skill at the NPC store and there are about 12 types of skills you can choose. As the designer, we prefer you to choose Movement speed. After upgrading, the next step is to explore the MAP. On the map, you will kill all the enemies that stop your way and they will drop coins to let you collect and upgrade. When you think you have enough coins, you can press "R" to teleport back to the first NPC you met at the beginning of the game. Then, it's time to upgrade other skills! We don't have any skills for healing the player, but you can collect the heart will might be dropped by enemies. When you explore the map, you will see some other NPC for you to upgrade your skills so DON'T WORRY! Then, when you finally reach the boss room. FIGHT IT and KILL it! Then, get into the portal and you will get into the next level of the game. The HP of the enemy and the damage will increase!! BE CAREFUL!

**Three TYPES OF ENEMIES**
1. Self-destruct Slim (When you reach the range, they will chase you, and BOOM! PLEASE!! Playe safe and stay in the safe area)
2. Cyber Ninjia (They are samurai patrolling with electric light knives, be careful not to go near them because their knives will tear you to pieces）
3. Robot guard dog (Don't worry! They're good enough to stand still but they'll detect you at a distance and want you to fire a cannonball. It's a long way! Please take shelter in time!）


# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer

**Describe the steps you took in your role as producer. Typical items include group scheduling mechanisms, links to meeting notes, descriptions of team logistics problems with their resolution, project organization tools (e.g., timelines, dependency/task tracking, Gantt charts, etc.), and repository management methodology.**
